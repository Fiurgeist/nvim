return {
	-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
	"tpope/vim-sleuth", -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--
	--  This is equivalent to:
	--    require('Comment').setup({})

	-- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
	{ "numToStr/Comment.nvim", opts = {} },

	-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
	-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
	--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
	--
	-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
	{ -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
		"lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim",
		opts = {
			signs = {
				add = { text = "+" },
				change = { text = "~" },
				delete = { text = "_" },
				topdelete = { text = "â€¾" },
				changedelete = { text = "~" },
			},
		},
	},

	-- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments
	{
		"folke/todo-comments.nvim",
		event = "VimEnter",
		dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
		opts = { signs = false },
	},

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded:
	--  config = function() ... end
	--
	--  see separate files
